A lightweight, beginner-friendly Python IDE with exactly 4 emoji buttons, dark/light themes, and a snake mascot.  
Because sometimes you just want to write Python without 5000 extensions.



## ✨ Features

### ✅ What It Does:
- **Python execution** with one click (▶ button)
- **File explorer** with icons (🐍 for .py, 📁 folders, 📄 files)
- **Double-click files** to open in editor
- **Syntax highlighting** (Python keywords, strings, comments)
- **Dark/light theme** toggle (🌙/☀️ button)
- **Output terminal** (properly sized, not tiny!)
- **Line numbers** (updates as you type)
- **Basic file operations** (New, Open, Save, Save As)
- **Menu system** with keyboard shortcuts
- **Splash screen** (because aesthetics matter)

### ❌ What It Doesn't Do:
- No Git integration (use terminal/your favorite Git GUI)
- No AI autocomplete (type your own code!)
- No plugin system (intentionally minimal)
- No multi-language support (Python only)
- No tabs (V2 feature)
- No debugger beyond `print()` (V2 feature)

## 🚀 Why Ball Python IDE?

### The Philosophy:
> "Most IDEs are either too simple (IDLE) or too complex (VS Code).  
> Ball Python IDE is the Goldilocks zone: just enough features to be useful,  
> not so many that you're overwhelmed."

### For:
- **Python beginners** who find VS Code intimidating
- **Quick script writing** without IDE overhead  
- **Teaching environments** where simplicity is key
- **Developers** who miss the simplicity of old-school tools
- **Anyone** who appreciates a good snake mascot 🐍
